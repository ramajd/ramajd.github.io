After a while finally I decided to restore back my personal blog, writting down
challenges I'm facing with, during my daily work. this time I decided to write in
English, might be more useful for the ones who might face same issues.
</p>

<p>
One of the challenges that I faced was to choose a proper platform to build my
blog on top of. using blog services like <i>Blogger</i> or <i>Wordpress</i> previously
they seemd to be kind of over-qualified for my needs. so I decided to switch to
static blog generators this time.
</p>

<p>
It's been a while that I'm using <i><a href="https://guix.gnu.org">GNU Guix</a></i> on my work and it was an opportunity
for me to use <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a></i> as my common text editor and IDE. working more with
Emacs, I love this editor much more.

<p>
Since for each problem you face, Emacs provides you a solution, it also has a
solution for my blogging Problem, <i><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a></i>. search for Emacs blogging tools,
there are a bunch of packages already available, and since I was looking for a
simple tool to allow me setup my blog rapidly, I decided to use
<i><a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">org-static-blog</a></i>.
</p>

<p>
In order to setup my blog, I just need to add an <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog#examples">initial configuration</a> to my
<code>init.el</code> file, create new post using <code>org-static-blog-create-new-post</code> and run
<code>org-static-blog-publish</code> to generate html files. after that the only thing that
I need to do was to publish generated files to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>.
