after a while finally I decided to restore back my personal weblog, writting
down challenges I'm facing during my daily work. this time I decided to write in
English might be more useful for the ones wthat might face same issues.

one of the challenges that I faced with was to choose a proper platform to build
th blog on. using blog services like /Blogger/ or /Wordpress/ they both were
kind of over-qualified for my needs. so I decided to switch to static blog
generators this time.

It's been a while that I'm using [[https://guix.gnu.org][GNU Guix]] on my work and it was an opportunity
for me to use /GNU Emacs/ as my common text editor and IDE. working more with
Emacs, I love this editor much more.

Since for each problem you face, Emacs provides a solution for, it also has a
solution for my Blogging Problem, /[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]/. search for blog tools for Emacs,
there are a bunch of packages already available, and since I was looking for a
simple tool to allow me setup my blog rapidly, I decided to use
/[[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog][org-static-blog]]/

in order to setup, I just need to add an [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog#examples][initial configuration]] to my ~init.el~
file, create new post using ~org-static-blog-create-new-post~ and run
~org-static-blog-publish~ to generate html files. after that the only thing that
I need to do is to publish generated files to
[[https://pages.github.com/][github pages]].
