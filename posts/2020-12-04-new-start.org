After a while finally I decided to restore back my personal blog, writting down
challenges I'm facing with, during my daily work. this time I decided to write in
English, might be more useful for the ones who might face same issues.

One of the challenges that I faced was to choose a proper platform to build my
blog on top of. using blog services like /Blogger/ or /Wordpress/ previously
they seemd to be kind of over-qualified for my needs. so I decided to switch to
static blog generators this time.

It's been a while that I'm using /[[https://guix.gnu.org][GNU Guix]]/ on my work and it was an opportunity
for me to use /[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]/ as my common text editor and IDE. working more with
Emacs, I love this editor much more.

Since for each problem you face, Emacs provides you a solution, it also has a
solution for my blogging Problem, /[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]/. search for Emacs blogging tools,
there are a bunch of packages already available, and since I was looking for a
simple tool to allow me setup my blog rapidly, I decided to use
/[[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog][org-static-blog]]/.

In order to setup my blog, I just need to add an [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog#examples][initial configuration]] to my
~init.el~ file, create new post using ~org-static-blog-create-new-post~ and run
~org-static-blog-publish~ to generate html files. after that the only thing that
I need to do was to publish generated files to [[https://pages.github.com/][github pages]].
