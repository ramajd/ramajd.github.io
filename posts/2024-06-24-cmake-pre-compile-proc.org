Oracle provides the /PreCompiler tools/ to allow developers to embed their
SQL queries inside their source code, for this purpose, we need to usee the
~proc~ precompiler shipped with this package to generate ~C/C++~ sources
for our SQL queries written in ~Pro* C~, and build our application against
the generated sources.

in order to run the ~proc~ as a prebuild step in our ~CMake~ project, I prepared
the following ~macro~ which precompile operation on list of files provided as
input and saves the target sources in provided variable name.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ramajd/0c6ae50993c9e6213a6cc041b6e97b1b.js"></script>
#+END_EXPORT

defining this macro, later we can use it as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
  compile_proc(
    ARG oracle_sources
    FILES
       file1.pc
       file2.pc
       file3.pc
  )

  add_executable(app
    ${oracle_sources}
    ...
  )
#+END_SRC
