#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Just read a /[[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2021-12/msg00095.html][thread]]/ on guix mailing list, about *adding udev rules* for a
package. in order to have an fixed reference about it, I decided to post it
here.
#+END_QUOTE

adding ~udev~ rules for a guix package is as easy as adding it to the
~<out>/lib/udev/rules.d/~ directory. so we can either add it as an ~INSTALL~
rule in our ~CMakefile.txt~ or add it to manually install the rules as part of
our package ~install~ phase:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (define-public package-name
    (package
     ...
     (arguments
      `(#:phases
        (modify-phases %standard-phases
         (add-after 'unpack 'patch-udev-rules
           (lambda* (#:key outputs #:allow-other-keys)
             (let ((out (assoc-ref outputs "out")))
               (substitute* "CMakefile.txt"
                            (("/ib/udev/rules.d")
                             (string-append out "/lib/udev/rules.d")))
               #t))))))
     ...))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (define-public package-name
    (package
     ...
     (arguments
      `(#:phases
        (modify-phases %standard-phases
         (add-after 'install 'install-udev-rules
           (lambda* (#:key outputs #:allow-other-keys)
             (let ((out (assoc-ref outputs "out")))
               (mkdir-p (string-append out "/lib/udev/rules.d"))
               (copy-file "123-my-custom-udev.rules"
                          (string-append out
                                         "/lib/udev/rules.d/"
                                         "123-my-custom-udev.rules"))
               #t))))))
     ...
     ))
