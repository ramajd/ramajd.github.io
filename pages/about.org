** About me
My name is /Reza Alizadeh Majd/, born an live in Tehran, Iran. Computer world was my passion from the childhood, and applying
for /Software Engineering/ was my only choice in university, and finally I got my BSc in /Software Engineering/ from /University of Arak/.

My main tech stack is based on ~C/C++~ mostly focused on ~Posix~ systems. I am also familiar with web development using ~Javascript~ and ~NodeJS~.

I also have a passion about *Free Software* and *Open Source* philosophy, and had contributions to the [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/log/?qt=author&q=Reza+Alizadeh+Majd][GNU Guix community]].
